# Project Zomboid Character Builder - Manifesto

## The Vision
We are building the ultimate character planner for the "Build 42" modded Project Zomboid server. This is not just a calculator; it is an immersive, utilitarian tool that fits the game's grim, tactical aesthetic.

## Core Problem
Vanilla character builders do not account for "Dynamic Traits" — traits that can be earned or lost in-game. Players waste points buying traits they could have grinded for free, or avoid negative traits they could easily remove.

## The Solution
A smart planner that explicitly warns players:
- "Don't buy this, you can earn it."
- "Take this, it's free points if you play right."

## Aesthetic
- **Cyberpunk / Tactical**: Dark, neon accents, high contrast.
- **Utilitarian**: Information density, clear readability.
